# Breakout Game

Breakout is a classic arcade game that was released in 1976. In this game, the player controls a paddle at the bottom and uses it to deflect a ball upwards to break a wall of bricks. The objective is to clear all the bricks without the ball touching the floor. Despite its age, breakout remains a popular game and is enjoyed by many players today.
